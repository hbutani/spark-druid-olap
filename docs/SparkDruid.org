Druid was designed to handle the ingest and analysis of large amounts
of *Event* data. This is a key capability in the AdTech/Marketing
and Internet-of-Things(IOT) spaces. In the AdTech arena events
generated from human activity are analyzed for doing User targeting,
Campaign attribution, Site optimization etc. In the IOT arena event
streams and analysis are at the heart of myriad of [[http://www.libelium.com/top_50_iot_sensor_applications_ranking/][Applications]] for
Smart Cities, Smart Environment, Smart Water etc.

Event Datasets are like flattened(wide denormalized tables)
multi-dimensional Cubes. Druid provides fast slice and dice capability
on the raw event data by building a multi-dimensional OLAP index that
is primarily partitioned on Time. OLAP indexes are a technique that is
used to speed-up slice and dice queries(MDX) on traditional cubes. SAP
[[http://scn.sap.com/community/bw-accelerator][BW Accelerator]]'s TREX Engine(the precursor to SAP Hana) is an
example of another OLAP index technology. Druid provides a REST based Query
interface over its Index. This is similar to SQL and there have been
efforts to provide [[https://github.com/srikalyc/Sql4D][SQL-like]] interfaces on top of Druid; but a full
fledged SQL interface is missing. 

On the other hand Apache Spark has a very rich LINQ like programming
model for expressing data analysis. It has rich SQL capabilities that
closely matches Hive SQL: standard join support, datatypes, analytical
functions, Cubing/Rollup, jdbc/odbc access etc. The
[[https://databricks.com/blog/2015/01/09/spark-sql-data-sources-api-unified-data-access-for-the-spark-platform.html][DataSources API]] enables federating external Datasets; enabling
bridging data from disparate systems and applying the 
analytic  capabilities of Spark on all of the data. 

There are 2 scenarios where we see the combination of Druid and Spark
adding a lot of value:
- For existing deployments of Druid, expose the Druid Index as a
  DataSource in Spark. This provides a proper SQL interface(with
  jdbc/odbc access) to the Druid dataset; it also enables
  analytics in Spark(SQL + advanced analytics) to utilize the fast navigation/aggregation
  capabilities of the Druid Index. The second point is the key: the
  goal is *fast SQL++ access on a denormalized/flat event
  Dataset*. One that marries the rich programming model of Spark with
  the fast access and aggregation capabilities of Druid. /This paper
  focuses on this scenario. Our initial development is for this scenario./ 
- Longer term , we envision using the Druid technology as an OLAP
  index for Star Schemas residing in Spark. This is classic OLAP
  space/performance tradeoff: a specialized secondary index to speed
  up queries.

The rest of the paper describes the details of the Spark Druid
Datasource that is built using the Spark DataSources API and a set of Plan
Rewrite techniques. We demonstrate how Querying against *raw event*
Datasets can be rewritten to use the Druid Index, and that these
rewritten Plan perform significantly better than the original Plans.

* Brief Introduction to Spark, Druid
** Druid

[[http://druid.io/][Apache Druid]] is data store designed for fast exploratory
analytics on a very large wide data set(think event streams). Its key capabilities and underlying
techniques are:

- a columnar storage format for partially nested data structures. 
- an olap/multi-dimensional distributed indexing structure
- arbitrary exploration of billion-row tables with sub-second latencies
- realtime ingestion (ingested data is immediately available for querying)
- fault-tolerant distributed architecture that doesn’t lose data.


Druid is architected as a group of services:
- Historical nodes :: handle storage and
     querying on "historical" data (non-realtime).
- Realtime nodes :: ingest data in real time. They are in charge of
                    accepring incoming data and  making
                    it available immediately to Queries. Aged data is
                    pushed to deep storage and picked up by Historical
                    nodes.
- Coordinator nodes ::  monitor historical nodes and
     ensure that data is available, replicated and in a  generally
     "optimal" configuration. 
- Broker nodes :: receive queries from clients and forward those
                  queries to Realtime and Historical nodes. They merge
                  these results before returning them to the client.
- Indexer nodes :: form a cluster of workers to load batch and
                   real-time data into the system

*** Druid Query Model

Queries are made using an HTTP REST style request. *Group By* queries
are the most generic type of queries, use them to specify the
DataSource, the [[http://druid.io/docs/0.8.0/querying/dimensionspecs.html][Dimensions to Group By]], the [[http://druid.io/docs/0.8.0/querying/granularities.html][Time Granularity]], [[http://druid.io/docs/0.8.0/querying/filters.html][Filters
on Dimensions]], [[http://druid.io/docs/0.8.0/querying/aggregations.html][Aggregations]], [[http://druid.io/docs/0.8.0/querying/limitspec.html][how to order and limit results]], and the
time intervals for which this query needs to run. [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/master/src/test/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/client/TPCHQueries.scala][Here]] are examples of
TPCH queries expressed as Druid Queries. *Timeseries* and *TopN* are
Druid Query types that can be used when certain constraints are met;
they provide better performance than running the Group-By
Query. Timeseries are significantly faster than groupBy queries for
aggregations that don't require grouping over dimensions. For grouping
and sorting over a single dimension, topN queries are much more
optimized than groupBys.

[[./DruidQueryModel.png]]

We provide a [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidQuerySpec.scala][Query Data model in Scala]] to define queries, and the
mechanics to interact with Druid to execute these Query Specifications
and fetch results.

** Spark
[[http://spark.apache.org/][Apache Spark]] is an in-memory, general-purpose cluster computing
system whose programming model is based on a [[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397926.aspx][LINQ]] style API on
datasets.  It provides a very rich Datasets API in Java, Scala, Python and R, and
a runtime engine that supports general execution graphs. On top of
this core it provides several higher level components:  Spark SQL for SQL
and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for
graph processing, and Spark Streaming.

The [[https://databricks.com/blog/2015/01/09/spark-sql-data-sources-api-unified-data-access-for-the-spark-platform.html][DataSources API]] enables Spark to integrate natively with a large
number of external sources. DataSources
have been written for Cassandra, JDBC DS, CSV etc. 
The DataSources abstraction
provides a mechanism by which processing in the form of /predicates
and column pruning/ can be pushed down to the external system where the Data resides.

* Spark and Druid
An obvious starting point is to just expose a Druid Index as a Spark
DataSource. This seems like a useful thing to do: it enables proper SQL
access; deeper analytics on the Event data is enabled without having
to copyof the event data(and more painful manage the copy) . But this is
not a very useful solution for the following reasons:
- the DataSource mechanics only allow predicate pushdown and column
  pruning; so aggregations have to be done in Spark; one of the big
  strengths of the Druid index is nullified.
- This treats Druid as the primary source of the data. In fact in most
  cases this is wrong. The usual Data setup is for raw data to land in
  hdfs or s3, for data to be indexed and possibly aggregated to a
  higher time grain. For example a Druid index may have aggregated
  information up to an  hour or day granularity. 

The fundamental problem with the Datasource only  approach is that it doesn't treat
Druid as an Index. What we want is to *make it appear that the raw
event DataSet is being accessed, and where possible to rewrite
Query Plans on this DataSet to use the Druid Index*.  The overall picture is:
- *raw event* data is landing in hdfs/s3, and a Druid Index is kept upto date.
- the Event data is exposed in the Spark Analytical platform as
  residing on the Deep Storage layer: hdfs/s3. 
- We setup a DataSource that wraps(and hence exposes the schema and
  data) of the *raw event* DataSet, but has access to the
  corresponding Druid Index. A companion Planning component than tries
  to rewrite Plans on the *raw event* Dataset to utilize the Index
  where possible.

* Druid DataSource for Spark
[[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DefaultSource.scala][DruidDataSource]] is a Spark Datasource that enables users to utilize
the Druid Index to accelerate OLAP style queries on the underlying
*raw event* Dataset. It  wraps the DataFrame
that exposes the /raw/ Dataset and also is provided with information
about the Druid Index for this Dataset. 

#+CAPTION: Druid Datasource
#+NAME:   fig:DruidDS
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil
[[./DruidDS.png]]


The DataSource is configured with the following parameters:

| Name                | Description                                 |
|---------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| sourceDataFrame     | The DataFrame that represents the raw Data  |
| druidHost/Port      | Information on how to connect to the Druid  |
|                     | Broker                                      |
| druidDatasource     | Name of the Druid Index for the raw dataset |
| timeDimensionColumn | The column from the raw dataset that is the |
|                     | time dimension in the Druid Index           |
| columnMappping      | a Map for mapping raw dataset column names  |
|                     | to column names in Druid.                   |
|                     |                                             |

Other parameters are also available/will be added to configure rewrites and Druid
behavior like functionalDependencies, maxCardinalityPerQuery,
maxResultCardinality etc. These will be documented in the future.

Here is a example of defining a Druid DataSource:
\begin{small}
   \lstset{keywordstyle=\bfseries\underbar, emphstyle=\underbar,
     language=SQL, showspaces=false, showstringspaces=false}
  \label{dDSdef}
   \begin{lstlisting}[caption={Defining a Druid DataSource},frame=shadowbox, numbers=left]
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE orderLineItemPartSupplier
      USING org.sparklinedata.druid
      OPTIONS (sourceDataframe "orderLineItemPartSupplierBase",
      timeDimensionColumn "l_shipdate",
      druidDatasource "tpch",
      druidHost "localhost",
      druidPort "8082",
      columnMapping '{  "l_quantity" : "sum_l_quantity", 
                         "ps_availqty" : "sum_ps_availqty" 
                     }     '
)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{small}

The raw dataset is exposed in the /orderLineItemPartSupplierBase/
DataFrame. There is a Druid Index on this Dataset called *tpch*, the
/l_shipdate/ column  is used as the time dimension for the
index.

When Spark asks the *Druid DataSource* to create the Relation it:
connects to Druid, reads the metadata about the specified Druid
datasource and sets up a [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/f0a3d26307560beea124931148511e4ed894a2e5/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidRelation.scala][DruidRelationInfo]] metadata object. It returns a
[[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/f0a3d26307560beea124931148511e4ed894a2e5/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidRelation.scala][DruidRelation]] a BaseRelation to the Spark engine The basic behavior of
/DruidRelation/ when asked for an RDD is to defer to
the underlying DataFrame(orderLineItemPartSupplierBase in the above
example). But if it has an associated [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/8de7d8d78955d48d0310c153b536b72a3537f037/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidRelation.scala#L21][DruidQuery]], it returns a
[[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/5a9ff6b0e9ba4de0d62a11e7de1e470fe1516183/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidRDD.scala][DruidRDD]]. A DruidQuery encapsulates a Druid Query specification, along
with a List of intervals on which to apply the Query, and information
on how to map the result into Spark Rows. DruidRDD is the bridge
between Spark and Druid. It runs the DruidQuery on Druid for each
interval(DruidRDD returns the results of each interval in a separate
partition).  For each Partition the compute call invokes the Druid
Broker with the Druid Query, the results are converted into a Iterator of Spark Rows. 

During planning, the [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/c73f7b2e9473e4769352b0564797717b88856224/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/druid/DruidPlanner.scala][DruidPlanner]] applies a set of rewrite rules to
convert a Logical Plan on the raw dataset DataFrame into a
DruidQuery. 

* Query Rewrites
Spark SQLContext allows the Spark Planner to be configured with extra
physical plan generation rules. These are applied before built-in
Physical transformation. We add the [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/c73f7b2e9473e4769352b0564797717b88856224/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/druid/DruidStrategy.scala][DruidStrategy]] to the SparkPlanner. 

** The DruidStrategy 
This relies on the  [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/c73f7b2e9473e4769352b0564797717b88856224/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/druid/DruidPlanner.scala][DruidPlanner]] to possibly convert a LogicalPlan into a
[[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/9020a969d2de788f037e2d8dece381018ee4afeb/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidQueryBuilder.scala][DruidQueryBuilder]]. If a LogicalPlan has an equivalent
DruidQueryBuilder, than this is converted into a SparkPlan with the
following steps:

1. Setup a  [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/8de7d8d78955d48d0310c153b536b72a3537f037/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidRelation.scala#L21][DruidQuery]] object: this contains the [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/3c5666a3bf055428957ada243826f217e96d2fb0/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidQuerySpec.scala][QuerySpec]] (a scala data
   structure that matches the Druid json
   [[http://druid.io/docs/0.8.0/querying/querying.html][information model for expressing queries]]), and the intervals this
   Query needs to run on. 
2. Setup a [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/f0a3d26307560beea124931148511e4ed894a2e5/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidRelation.scala][DruidRelation]] with the the [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/f0a3d26307560beea124931148511e4ed894a2e5/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidRelation.scala][DruidRelationInfo]] metadata object
   and  [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/8de7d8d78955d48d0310c153b536b72a3537f037/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidRelation.scala#L21][DruidQuery]] object.
3. Setup a Physical Plan that looks like
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
Project
  PhysicalRDD(druidRelation.buildScan)
\end{Verbatim}

The PhysicalRDD wraps the RDD provided by the DruidRelation. The
Projection takes care of any dataType mappings and evaluating
expressions on aggregation  from the Aggregation Operator original Plan..

** DruidPlanner
The  [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/c73f7b2e9473e4769352b0564797717b88856224/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/druid/DruidPlanner.scala][DruidPlanner]] is the the entry point for
the Druid rewrite functionality. It is a container of [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/druid/DruidTransforms.scala][DruidTransforms]].
In order to enable rewrites the user
needs to invoke =DruidPlanner(sqlContext)=. This registers
 [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/c73f7b2e9473e4769352b0564797717b88856224/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/druid/DruidStrategy.scala][DruidStrategy]] with the SparkPlanner. A  [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/druid/DruidTransforms.scala][DruidTransform]] is responsible
for converting a Logical Plan into a [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidQueryBuilder.scala][DruidQueryBuilder]]. A
DruidQueryBuilder is a case class that captures information about a
Druid Query. It also captures mapping information from Spark
Expressions to Results coming out of Druid: including dataType and
column name mappings. There are several  [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/druid/DruidTransforms.scala][DruidTransforms]] to convert different
Plan trees to a DruidQuery, but the Logical Plan must at least contain
an Aggregation Operator. More on this in the Query Rewrite Rules section.

** Mapping Druid results into Spark Rows
*** Query Building: Column Name, Type mapping
The [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidQueryBuilder.scala][DruidQueryBuilder]] mainatins a map from the Druid Query Result
columnName to the  triple: (Expression, spark DataType, druid DataType):
- Expression is the [[https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9914b1b2c5d5fe020f54d95f59f03023de2ea78a/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/Expression.scala][Catalyst Expression]] from the original Plan that the Druid column in the Result row represents. 
- The DataType of the Expression in the original SQL plan.
- The DataType of the value returned by Druid.

The 2 datatypes need not match; during rewrite a check is made to see
if the conversion from the Druid datatype to Spark Expression datatype
is valid.  If not, the rewrite doesn't happen.
This map is populated as expressions from the Aggregate Operator are
added to the DruidQueryBuilder.

*** Setting up the Output Schema of the PhysicalRDD Operator that wraps the Druid RDD
The schema for the PhysicalRDD Operator is formed by creating a
StructType from each of the columns in the output Map maintained by
the DruidQueryBuilder. For Grouping Expressions that were
AttributeReferences in the original Plan, we reuse their ExprIds; for
non AttributeReferences new ExprIds are generated. This way any
resolved AttributeReferences above the replaced Plan SubTree are still
valid and point to the correct child Attribute in the rewritten Plan.

*** Projection on top of the PhysicalRDD Operator.
A Projection Operator is added above the PhysicalRDD Operator to:
- provide the same schema as the original Aggregate Operator. (or the
  Ordering/Filter Operator  above the Agg.Op in case of having/order/limit rewrites)
- To ensure Attribute names, ExprId and DataTypes match what was in the original Operator.

The ProjectionList is formed from the aggregation expressions of the
original Agg. Operator. Any expressions that were mapped to  Druid
Result columns are replaced by AttributeReferences to  the child
PhysicalRDD Attributes.  The following rules are followed:
- If needed the AttributeReference is wrapped in a cast to convert to the original Spark Plan's dataType.
- AttributeReferences in the original Plan carry the original ExprId,
  so that references above this Operator remain valid.  Names from the
  original AttributeReference are also maintained by wrapping the new AttributeReference in an Alias.

** TPCH Flattened Cube example
We explain the Rewrite rules by giving examples from the following
setup. Consider a raw transaction log that is based on the
[[http://www.tpc.org/tpch/spec/tpch2.8.0.pdf][TPCH benchmark specification]]

\begin{small}
   \lstset{keywordstyle=\bfseries\underbar, emphstyle=\underbar,
     language=SQL, showspaces=false, showstringspaces=false}
  \label{tpchFlat}
   \begin{lstlisting}[caption={The TPCH denormalized DataFrame},frame=shadowbox, numbers=left]
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE orderLineItemPartSupplierBase(
   o_orderkey integer, o_custkey integer,
   o_orderstatus string, o_totalprice double, 
   o_orderdate string, o_orderpriority string, 
   o_clerk string, o_shippriority integer, 
   o_comment string, l_partkey integer, 
   l_suppkey integer, l_linenumber integer, 
   l_quantity double, l_extendedprice double, 
   l_discount double, l_tax double, 
   l_returnflag string,l_linestatus string, 
   l_shipdate string, l_commitdate string, 
   l_receiptdate string, l_shipinstruct string, 
   l__shipmode string, l_comment string, 
   order_year string, ps_partkey integer, 
   ps_suppkey integer,ps_availqty integer, 
   ps_supplycost double, ps_comment string, 
   s_name string, s_address string, 
   s_phone string, s_acctbal double, 
   s_comment string, s_nation string, 
   s_region string, p_name string, 
   p_mfgr string, p_brand string, 
   p_type string, p_size integer, 
   p_container string, p_retailprice double, 
   p_comment string, c_name string , 
   c_address string , c_phone string , 
   c_acctbal double ,c_mktsegment string , 
   c_comment string , c_nation string , 
   c_region string)
USING com.databricks.spark.csv
OPTIONS (
  path "tpchFlattenedData_10/orderLineItemPartSupplierCustomer", 
  header "false", delimiter "|"
)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{small}

This is a single transaction table that is formed by
denormalizing(flattening) the TPCH Star Schema. We have a [[https://github.com/SparklineData/tpch-spark-druid/blob/master/tpchData/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/tpch/TpchGenMain.scala][TpchGen]] tool
for creating a flattened transaction table from an existing Tpch Star
schema.

Also assume there is a Druid Index built for this DataSet and is
exposed in Spark as a [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DefaultSource.scala][DruidDataSource]]

\begin{small}
   \lstset{keywordstyle=\bfseries\underbar, emphstyle=\underbar,
     language=SQL, showspaces=false, showstringspaces=false}
  \label{tpchDruidDF}
   \begin{lstlisting}[caption={TPCH Druid DataSource},frame=shadowbox, numbers=left]
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE orderLineItemPartSupplier
      USING org.sparklinedata.druid
      OPTIONS (sourceDataframe "orderLineItemPartSupplierBase",
      timeDimensionColumn "l_shipdate",
      druidDatasource "tpch",
      druidHost "localhost",
      druidPort "8082",
      columnMapping '{  "l_quantity" : "sum_l_quantity", 
                         "ps_availqty" : "sum_ps_availqty" 
                     }     '
)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{small}

So queries are rewritten against the 'orderLineItemPartSupplier'
table. For example TPCH Q1 is written as:

\begin{small}
   \lstset{keywordstyle=\bfseries\underbar, emphstyle=\underbar,
     language=SQL, showspaces=false, showstringspaces=false}
  \label{tpchSampleQuery}
   \begin{lstlisting}[caption={Sample Query},frame=shadowbox, numbers=left]

select l_returnflag, l_linestatus, count(*), 
       sum(l_extendedprice) as s, max(ps_supplycost) as m,
       avg(ps_availqty) as a,count(distinct o_orderkey)
from orderLineItemPartSupplier
group by l_returnflag, l_linestatus
\end{lstlisting}
\end{small}

Without the DruidPlanner configured these queries will run as if they
are issued against the underlying sourceDataFrame, in this case
against the wrapped DataSource 'orderLineItemPartSupplierBase'.

** Query Rewrite and Validation Rules

Plans that can be rewritten must have the following core structure.

#+CAPTION: Core Plan Structure
#+NAME:   fig:PlanStructure
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :height 5cm :center
[[./PlanStructure.png]]

The base of the Plan must be a Physical RDD Operator on a
[[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/f0a3d26307560beea124931148511e4ed894a2e5/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/DruidRelation.scala][DruidRelation]], followed by 0 or more Project/Filter criteria,
followed by an Aggregation. Only plans with this core structure are
considered for rewrite. On top of the Aggregation, there can
optionally be a Filter(representing the SQL having clause), a Sort and
a Limit.

*** Validation 1: Base table column validation

Columns referenced in the Project below the Aggregate must have a
corresponding column in the Druid Index.

*** Rewrite 2: Filter Rewrite

The Filter predicates are combined into *Conjunctive Normal Form*. An
attempt is made to rewrite each conjunct. If any conjunct
cannot be rewritten, then the Plan is not rewritten.

**** Rewrite 2.1: Interval condition rewrite

A predicate of the form 
=compOp(dateTime(timeDim), literalDateTime)=
is extracted as an /time Interval/ of the Druid Query.

Where 'compOp' can be the following functions: 
=dateIsBeforeFn, dateIsBeforeOrEqualFn, dateIsAfterFn,
dateIsAfterOrEqualFn=. The comparison needs to be on the column that
is the time dimension in the Druid Index(in our example the
'l_shipDate' column). The literal-date is an expression representing a
date. It can be a literal date specified with
=dateTime, dateTimeWithTZFn, dateTimeWithFormatFn,
dateTimeWithFormatAndTZFn= optionally followed by( +/-) a /Period/
specification. For example the following predicate is translated to
the Interval ("1992-12-01", "1997-09-02") : 
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
dateIsBeforeOrEqual(
   dateTime(`l_shipdate`),
   dateMinus(
     dateTime("1997-12-01"),
     period("P90D")
   )
)
\end{Verbatim}

It is much easier to read when specified using [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-datetime][spark-dateTime dsl]]
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
dateTime('l_shipdate) <= (dateTime("1997-12-01") - 90.day)
\end{Verbatim}

Currently we only translate the SQL predicates into a single
interval. The [[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/b7c5c5efb6d4f0be6ea0be8cbc71e50a91414fd2/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/QueryIntervals.scala][QueryIntervals]] class is setup to handle multiple
intervals. In the future we plan to  handle a disjunction of date
Predicates in each conjunct.

**** Rewrite 2.2: Dimension Filter rewrite

Predicates of the form =dimCol compOp Literal= or =Literal compOp
dimCol= are converted into
[[http://druid.io/docs/0.8.0/querying/filters.html][Filter Specifications]] on the Druid Query. The column being compared
must be a dimension column in the Druid Index. The comparator operator
needs to be ~<,>, <=, >=,=~. Comparison predicates can be combined
with logical =and, or= operators.

*** Rewrite 3: Grouping Expressions

A Group-By expression can be on a Druid index dimension or a dateTime expression
on a regular  or time dimension in the Druid index. The dateTime
expression must be of the form ~dateElem(dateTimeFn(col))~. The
'dateTimeFn' form must be ~dateTime, withZone(dateTime...~, that is a
dateTime expression or a dateTime with Timezone application. The
column must be a dimension or the time column of the Druid Index. The
element being extracted can be any of:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
era, century, yearOfEra, yearOfCentury, year, weekyear, 
monthOfYear, monthOfYearName,weekOfWeekyear, 
dayOfYear, dayOfMonth, dayOfWeek, dayOfWeekName,
hourOfDay, secondOfMinute
\end{Verbatim}

An  expression on a dimension is expressed as a
[[http://druid.io/docs/0.8.0/querying/dimensionspecs.html][DefaultDimension Specification]] the DruidQuery. While a time element
expression is converted to a [[http://druid.io/docs/0.8.0/querying/dimensionspecs.html][TimeFormatExtraction Specification]].

*** Rewrite 4: Aggregation Expressions

From the aggregation list we extract the AggregateFunction
invocations, and attempt to translate them to Druid [[http://druid.io/docs/0.8.0/querying/aggregations.html][Aggregation]]  and
[[http://druid.io/docs/0.8.0/querying/post-aggregations.html][PostAggregation]] Specifications on the Druid Query. On the translated Plan a Project
operator is placed on top of the Druid Relation to compute any
expressions that the Aggregate Function invocations were part of. So
for the expression  ~sum(p_retailprice) - 5~: the ~sum(p_retailprice)~ is pushed to
the Druid Query; the subtraction on the sum is handled in the Project
Operator on top.

The following rules are used to translate Aggregate functions

- Count :: ~Count(1)~ is translated to a Cardinality Aggregation
           Specification.
- Sum, Min, Max :: The aggregation must be on a Druid Metric
                   column. The dataType of the expression must be
                   convertible from the Druid metric dataType without
                   loss of precision. The expression is translated to
                   a Function Aggregation Specification on the Druid
                   Query.
- Avg :: This has the same constraints as Sum/Min/Max. It is converted
         to a Post Aggregation  Specification of
         dividing the Sum by the Count.
- CountDistinct :: Is converted to  Cardinality Aggregation
                   Specification. Druid uses HyperLogLog to estimate
                   this. So in the future we will add a parameter to
                   the DataSource, so users can control if this
                   rewrite should be allowed.

*** Rewrite 5: Having predicates (TBD)

Predicates on the Aggregation expressions will be pushed down as
Having Specifications in the Druid Query.

*** Rewrite 6: Sort Operator (TBD)

A Sort Operator on top of Aggregation will be pushed down as a Limit
Specification in the Druid Query.

*** Rewrite 7: Limit Operator (TBD)

A Limit Operator on top of a Sort will be pushed down as a limit value
on the   Limit Specification in the Druid Query.

*** Rewrite 8: Enhanced Time Granularity and Interval Handling

We currently assume that the Druid Index has the same Time Granularity
and Range as the *raw* data. This is obviously not necessary, and in
practice an uncommon way to setup the Index. More likely, the Index is
on a Grain(hourly, daily) higher than the raw events. Also index for
old data maybe removed for space reasons.

*Shorter Time Range for Druid Index*

It is likely that the DruidIndex is maintained for a smaller Time
window like the last year; whereas the raw dataset is for much longer
time window. In such cases the original Plan should be converted into
a *union all Plan*. The component queries  being a Druid Query on the Time Window that is in the Druid
Index(and intersects with the Query predicate) and a Spark Query on
the raw event DataSource for the remaining Time Window.

*Druid Index on a higher Time Grain.*

It is likely that the Druid Index doesn't hold raw data, but is
aggregated up to a minimum time grain such as an hour or a day. In
this the original Plan can only be rewritten if the Query has a Time
Aggregation that is at a higher grain than the
granularity in the Druid Index.

* Benchmark
We ran a benchmark to test a set of queries that contrast performance
of the scenario of queries being rewritten to use a DruidIndex vs
running the Queries directly against the *raw event* DataSet. We have
attempted to make this test as fair as possible: by not taking any
advantages of preaggregations and column pruning in Druid, by using in
memory caching when the queries run only in Spark. We ran the 2
scenarios on the same cluster: for the Druid run we gave the worker
node resources to Druid History servers, for the Spark run we ran
Spark Executors on the worker nodes.

We ran the test on  [[http://www.tpc.org/tpch/spec/tpch2.8.0.pdf][TPCH benchmark dataset]], datascale
10G. *But since we flatten the dataset, the starting size as a raw
flattened dataset is 46GB.*

** Cluster Details
The Benchmark was run on a 4 node cluster. Each node is a 2 core,16GB
memory, 256GB hard drive machine running centos 6.4. The output of the

The machines are setup with [[http://hortonworks.com/hdp/whats-new/][HDP 2.3]] using  [[https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Quick+Start+Guide][Ambari]]. Also installed
[[http://static.druid.io/artifacts/releases/druid-0.8.0-bin.tar.gz][Druid 0.8]] on the machines. The cluster is configured to use Yarn; we
installed and setup  [[http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html][Spark 1.4.1]] to run using the Yarn Resource
Manager.

** TPCH Flattened Dataset, scale 10
For the benchmark we used the [[http://www.tpc.org/tpch/spec/tpch2.8.0.pdf][TPCH benchmark dataset]], datascale
10G. We converted the 10G star schema into a flattened(denormalized)
transaction dataset using a tool we wrote [[https://github.com/SparklineData/tpch-spark-druid/blob/master/tpchData/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/tpch/hadoop/TpchGenFlattenedData.scala][TpchGenFlattenedData]], for
example we ran it like this:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
spark/bin/spark-submit –num-executors 7 \
–properties-file spark-druid/spark.properties \
–packages com.databricks:spark-csv2.10:1.1.0 \
–jars spark-druid/spark-datetime-assembly-0.0.1.jar,\
      spark-druid/spark-druid-olap-assembly-0.0.1.jar \
–class org.sparklinedata.tpch.hadoop.TpchGenFlattenedData \
spark-druid/tpchdata-assembly-0.0.1.jar \
tpchflatorc10 tpchflattened
\end{Verbatim}

** Dataset for Spark Queries
For spark we further processed the data to setup a Partitioned table,
stored in Parquet format; the table is partitioned by day. We use the
[[https://github.com/SparklineData/tpch-spark-druid/blob/master/tpchData/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/tpch/hadoop/TpchBuildParquetPartitioned.scala][TpchBuildParquetPartitioned]] to do this. 

** Druid Index for TPCH Flattened Dataset
The Druid Index was created using the [[http://druid.io/docs/latest/ingestion/batch-ingestion.html][HadoopDruidIndexer]] with the
following command:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
java -Xmx256m -Dhdp.version=2.3.0.0-2557 -Duser.timezone=UTC \
-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath \
$DIR/config/_common:$HADOOP_CONF_DIR:$DIR/lib/* \
io.druid.cli.Main index hadoop <spec_file>
\end{Verbatim}

See [[Druid TPCH Index Specification]] for detailed specification of the
TPCH index in Druid. Key points of the Index:
- /l_shipdate/ is chosen as the time dimension. Based on the TPCH
  Query set, there is a significant number of queries that are time
  sliced based on the Ship Date.
- We indexed all the dimensions. The metrics are: ~o_totalprice,
  l_quantity, l_extendedprice, ps_availqty, ps_supplycost,
  c_acctbal~. Rest of the columns are modeled as dimensions.
- *The index is created at the grain of raw events.*
- The Index time segment is chosen to be month.

Note by choosing to model all dimensions and by choosing to index at
the grain of events, we have made the Druid Index as big as
possible. *We are note giving Druid any advantages of preaggregation
or column pruning.* 

** DataSource setup

The raw event DataSource and Druid datasource are defined in the
following way:

\begin{small}
   \lstset{keywordstyle=\bfseries\underbar, emphstyle=\underbar,
     language=SQL, showspaces=false, showstringspaces=false}

      USING org.sparklinedata.druid
      OPTIONS (sourceDataframe "$baseFlatTableName",
      timeDimensionColumn "l_shipdate",
      druidDatasource "tpch",
      druidHost "${cfg.druidBroker}",
      druidPort "8082");

\end{lstlisting}

** Queries

- aggregation on the entire dataset
- aggregation on a time slice
- aggregation on a time slice with Dimension Filters applied.

** Running the Benchmark

*** Running against Druid Datasource
For the Druid Datasource experiment the queries are run on spark using the
[[https://github.com/SparklineData/spark-druid-olap/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/druid/tools/TpchBenchMark.scala][Druid TpchBenchMark]] tool. It is run using the following command:
\begin{small}
   \lstset{keywordstyle=\bfseries\underbar, emphstyle=\underbar,
     language=bash, showspaces=false, showstringspaces=false}
  \label{tpchDruidBmark}

\end{lstlisting}
\end{small}

The cluster is setup to run a historical server on each node. Each
historical server is configure with 8GB of memory:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
JAVA_HISTORICAL_OPTIONS="-server \

 -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError \
 -Duser.timezone=UTC \
 -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"
\end{Verbatim}

The spark shell is run in local mode on one of the nodes, so that
Spark uses as little cluster resources as possible.

*** Running against cached Spark DataFrame
We compare the rewritten queries against the case of not having a
Druid Index. In this case we try to give the Spark engine as much
advantage as we can. 

We give the Spark executors as much of the Yarn cluster
as possible. The Spark configuration is:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
spark.serializer=org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer
#spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=100000000
spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1
spark.sql.planner.externalSort=true

spark.executor.memory=9g
spark.driver.memory=2g
#spark.executor.cores=2
\end{Verbatim}

*As part of the initialization, the orderLineItemPartSupplier
DataFrame is cached in memory.*

For the queries going against Spark we used the
[[https://github.com/SparklineData/tpch-spark-druid/blob/master/tpchData/src/main/scala/org/sparklinedata/tpch/hadoop/TpchParquetBenchmark.scala][Spark TpchBenchmark]] tool. It is run with the following command:

** Benchmark Results

*Data Sizes:*

| TPCH Flat TSV                      | 46.80GB |
| Druid Index in HDFS                | 13.27GB |
| TPCH Flat Parquet Partition by Day | 11.56GB |

As we said the raw dataset size after flattening is 46GB. So the test
really is for a dataset which is about 50GB. The on-disk size of the
Druid Index and a Parquet representation is about a 4th of the raw
size. Parquet has about a 15% smaller footprint.

*Results for Queries, when rewritten to use Druid:*

| Query                                              | Avg. Time | Min. Time | Max. Time |
|----------------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------|
| Basic Aggregation                                  | 17146.000 |     15215 |     19150 |
| Ship Date Range                                    |  3771.000 |      3196 |      5007 |
| SubQuery + nation,Type predicates + ShipDate Range |   794.000 |       668 |       993 |
| TPCH Q1                                            | 15950.000 |     15282 |     17186 |

The numbers are in milliSeconds. Not surprisingly the 3rd query has great performance: it is tailor
made for Druid: there is a filter on nation, part type and a ship date
range. The 2nd query: a ship date range query with a aggregation by
returnFlag and linestatus also show good perform compared to queries
that have to scan all of the Data. The 1st and 4th queries don't
leverage the Druid Index's layout: all the data needs to be scanned.
So such queries ran in 15-17 seconds on our cluster.

*Results for Queries, when running on cached raw event DataFrames:*

| Query                                              |   Avg. Time | Min. Time | Max. Time |

The runs for running on Spark were not very stable. We
see periodic Executor failures, which result in tasks being rerun. We
gave the Spark Executors more memory than the Druid History servers,
so the resources allocated are comparable. Let's compare the best
times from this case against the queries being offloaded to Druid. We
see that the Queries that scan the whole dataset: queries 1 and 4 are
6-8 times slower. This is surprising: a possible explanation is that
the aggregation performance of Druid is better; also the in-memory
representation in Spark maybe the cause of this difference. 

The range
query(query 2) is about 20 times slower; we tried to nullify any
advantages in Druid, by partitioning by day, and specifying the date
predicate in such a way that triggers partition pruning. Inspite of
this Druid seems to give a boost for such queries. If we consider a
factor of 8 advantage to Druid (assuming that full scan queries should
have about the same performance on the 2 systems); even then Druid
performs 2-2.5 better on this query. 

For the query with a time Slice and Dimension filters, Druid is vastly
superior. We were expecting Druid to be better, but the difference is
performance is surprising: Druid is about 100 times faster. In a real
workload we expect a sizable percentage of queries to be off this
form.
